# Introduction to Web Development Project

## Overview
This project is a simple personal webpage created as part of an Introduction to Web Development course. It demonstrates fundamental web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a clean, responsive, and interactive website.

The page serves as a personal landing site with navigation links, a dynamic banner ad, news images linking to popular Namibian news outlets, a blog section, useful resource links, and a latest updates panel.

## Features
- **Responsive Layout:** Uses a three-column table layout with images, navigation, and updates.
- **Navigation Bar:** Links to Home, Contact Details, About Me, Login, and Register pages.
- **Dynamic Banner Ad:** A clickable banner that changes content and color when clicked.
- **News Links:** Images linking to major Namibian news websites (The Namibian, NBC, New Era).
- **Blog Section:** Displays recent blog posts with titles, authors, dates, and summaries.
- **Useful Resources:** A curated list of helpful external links for learning digital security, programming, health, and finance.
